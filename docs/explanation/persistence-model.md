# Persistence Model

Devcontainers are rebuilt frequently. Without persistence, every rebuild would
reset agent CLI configuration, authentication state, and session history.

This collection uses **named Docker volumes** mounted at each agent's home
directory (or config path). The model is **per-agent**, not Claude-only.

## Named volume per agent home

Templates that support persistence declare mounts like:

```json
"mounts": [
    "source=claude-cli-config-${devcontainerId},target=/home/vscode/.claude,type=volume"
]
```

The `${devcontainerId}` variable is resolved by the Dev Container CLI to a
stable identifier for the workspace. Rebuilding the same workspace keeps the
same volume; deleting the volume clears that agent's persisted state.

## Expected mount targets

| Agent / surface | Typical mount target                         | Notes                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Claude Code     | `/home/vscode/.claude`                       | Layer A ollama-claude-cli\* family |
| Grok Build      | `/home/vscode/.grok`                         | Layer B grok templates             |
| Codex           | `/home/vscode/.codex`                        | Layer B                            |
| Gemini          | `/home/vscode/.gemini`                       | Layer B                            |
| Pi              | `/home/vscode/.pi`                           | Layer B                            |
| Hermes          | `/home/vscode/.hermes`                       | Layer B                            |
| OpenCode        | `~/.local/share/opencode` and/or config path | May need more than one mount       |
| Multi-AI        | One volume **per** agent home above          | See `multi-ai-cli`                 |

## Current template status (honesty)

Named-volume mounts are the portfolio model for Layer A–C agent auth survival.

| Template                                               | Home mounts today                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ollama-claude-cli*`                                   | Yes (`~/.claude`)                                                                |
| `multi-ai-cli`                                         | Yes (per-agent homes; OpenCode via community host binds, not named volumes)      |
| `gemini-cli`, `pi-coding-agent`, `hermes-agent`        | Yes                                                                              |
| `codex-cli`                                            | Via community (sliekens) host binds — **no** template named volume (conflicts with feature `onCreate` symlinks) |
| `grok-build-cli` / `-studio`                           | Via our feature host binds — **no** template named volume |
| `opencode-cli`                                         | Via community feature host binds (`~/.local/share` + `~/.config` → `/var/lib/…`) |
| Layer D (`cloud-native-k8s`, `data-engineering-spark`) | No agent home mounts (not agent-auth workspaces)                                 |

**Canonical Layer B stem:** `{template-id}-home-${devcontainerId}` only for agents **without** a community feature that already bind-mounts + symlinks home (today: Gemini, Pi, Hermes). **Codex / OpenCode** use sliekens community feature host binds → `/var/lib/…` + `onCreate` symlinks; **Grok** uses our feature host binds; named volumes on those homes break smoke. Multi-ai uses `multi-ai-{agent}-…` only for agents that still take named volumes.

## Per-project isolation

The `${devcontainerId}` suffix isolates state per project so settings from one
workspace do not leak into another.

## What is persisted

Everything under the mounted agent home (for example under `~/.claude`):

- CLI settings and local config
- Authentication / session state written by the agent
- User-level files written by features or bootstrap scripts into that path

## What is not persisted

Everything outside the named volume and outside the workspace bind mount:

- System packages not baked into the image
- Files under `/home/vscode` that are not on a named volume
- Container process state

## Rebuild behavior

`devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --build-no-cache` replaces the container
but reuses named volumes. Bootstrap/`postCreateCommand` may re-run; persisted
agent state remains if the mount was declared.

## Cleaning up

```bash
docker volume ls | grep -E 'claude-cli-config-|multi-ai-|gemini-cli-home-|pi-coding-agent-home-'
# docker volume rm <volume-name>
```

Removing a volume resets that agent surface for that workspace.
